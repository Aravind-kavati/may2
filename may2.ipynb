    "3)Unsupervised anomaly detection does not require labeled training data and aims to identify anomalies solely based on the characteristics of the data itself. It seeks to discover patterns, structures, or deviations that are not present in the majority of the data. Supervised anomaly detection, on the other hand, uses labeled training data with both normal and anomalous instances to learn a model that can classify new instances as normal or anomalous."

    "6)The anomaly score of each sample is called the Local Outlier Factor. It measures the local deviation of the density of a given sample with respect to its neighbors. It is local in that the anomaly score depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. More precisely, locality is given by k-nearest neighbors, whose distance is used to estimate the local density. By comparing the local density of a sample to the local densities of its neighbors, one can identify samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors. These are considered outliers."
